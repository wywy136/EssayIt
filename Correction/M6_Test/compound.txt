The man who helped you is Mr White.
That is the person whom you want to see.
He is the father whose son studies very well in our class.
IÂ´m not the fool that you thought me to be.
He is such a lazy man as nobody wants to work with.
The only thing that we can do is to give you some advice.
A dictionary is a useful book which tells us the meaning of words
He lives in a room whose window faces south
It is such a big stone as nobody can lift.
As is known to all, he is the best student.
