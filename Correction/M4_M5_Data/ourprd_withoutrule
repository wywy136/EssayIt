Everyone has a lot of dreams .
Some people want to be rich , dreaming of becoming millionaires overnight .
Others want to be famous , dreaming of suddenly jumping into great fame .
I have a lot of dreams , too .
When I was a young girl , I dreamed of becoming a scientist like Hua Luogen in the future .
However , I knew very well that I could not succeed without painstaking efforts .
So I studied hard in middle school and college in order to attain my goal .
After graduating from college , I found a job as a teacher .
Although I was very busy teaching , I never gave up my goal .
I read a lot of books to gain more knowledge .
I made experiments to practice and apply for what I learned from books .
Sometimes , I was so deeply indulged in my research that I forgot my meals and time .
Now I have made great progress .
Several of my research papers have been published .
The methods proposed in my papers have been proven to be valuable for the solution of some problems .
I am very happy .
The ladder of becoming a scientist is still far ahead , but I have climbed the first rung anyway .
