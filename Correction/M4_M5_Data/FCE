As the saying goes , true friendship can exist forever .
It 's important to everyone .
If you possess it , you should be valued by it .
Because of that , it can bring your success .
For example , at ZhanGuo period there are two people called Guanzhong and Baoshuya .
At their young times they have a business together .
Baoshuya is a little greedy , but Guan did n't mind it .
He even says Bao do that was because his mother was killed and needed money .
Afterwards , Guan was appointed to the prime minister .
He can get this position as a Bao's recommendation .
Friendship on utility can not be forever .
A couple of virtuous friends are like that they can face trouble together and share commitment with each other .
No matter what happened , true friendship would give a good influence on you at any time .
So we should keep it and make it to be a permanent thing .
